# JobsDoneApp

## Current goal of the app
To give all people a quick, easy and fun way to announce that they have done their job.

No, realy. That's all their is to it. The is an Apache Cordova app (for multiple platforms) and all it has is a button in the middle of screen, that when clicked, announces "Job's done".

## Future goals
To add more variety of modes and sounds. For example, a second button that yells "Just do it!".

Enjoy your new best companion.
