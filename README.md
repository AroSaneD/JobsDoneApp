# JobsDoneApp

## Primary goal of the app
To give all people a quick, easy and fun way to announce that they have done their job.

No, realy. That's all their is to it. The is an Apache Cordova app (for multiple platforms) and all it has is a button in the middle of screen, that when clicked, announces "Job's done".

Enjoy your new best companion.
